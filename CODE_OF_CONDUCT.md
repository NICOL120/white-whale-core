# Code of Conduct

White Whale has a friendly and welcoming environment, and we want to keep it that way. We accept and respect everybody equally, but we 
don't tolerate harassing, trolling or spamming. All White Whale contributors are expected to be respectful towards other members 
of the team and the community. We are here to build, not to engage in toxic behavior. 

We don't mind your gender, race, religion or whatever, as long as you are nice to others. We expect you to act professionally, 
respect other people's opinions and act on the best interest of the protocol.

## TLDR

Be kind.
